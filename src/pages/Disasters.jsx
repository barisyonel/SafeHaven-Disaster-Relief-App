        <h1>What is an Earthquake?</h1>
        <p>
          The event of sudden vibrations that occur due to fractures in the
          earth's crust and spread in waves, shaking the environments and the
          earth's surface through which they pass is called an earthquake.
        </p>
        <h1> How Does an Earthquake Occur?</h1>
        <p>
          Earthquakes occur in fractures called fault lines in the earth's
          crust. These fault lines occur when the rock breaks under high
          pressure (compression, tension or bending) due to its brittle nature.
          Stress occurs at different points in the earth's crust as a result of
          the gradual movement of the plates. Earthquakes occur when the tension
          in a rocky area increases enough to cause a sudden movement. This
          movement can cause the rock to break at its weakest point, creating a
          new fault line, or the rocks can slide along an existing fault. As a
          result of both causes, a very large amount of energy is released when
          the tension is released. The vibration created by this energy in the
          surrounding rock masses creates the natural disaster earthquake. The
          point where the fracture or slip in the rocks causing the earthquake
          begins is called the earthquake focus, and the area directly above
          this point is called the earthquake center.
        </p>
        <p>
			<h1>What should we do during an earthquake?</h1>
			<p>Protect your head by holding it between your hands or with a protective material (pillow, book, etc.). Wait until the shaking stops. Find a safe place, kneel down, COVER to protect your head and neck, and HOLD ON to something stable to avoid falling. During an earthquake, stay where you are until the shaking stops.</p>
          <strong>Effects:</strong> Ground shaking, building collapse, tsunamis,
          fires.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Preparation:</strong> Secure heavy furniture, create a family
          emergency plan, practice "Drop, Cover, and Hold On."

		<h1>What is a Flood?</h1>
		<p>Occurs when water overflows from a body of water such as a river, lake or ocean. Floods can occur when water accumulates or breaks through banks, causing some of the water to escape from its normal boundaries, or they can occur when rainwater accumulates on saturated ground in an areal flood.</p>
        <p>
          Floods occur due to heavy rain, overflowing rivers, or dam failures.
          They can destroy homes and cut off essential services.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Effects:</strong> Property damage, water contamination,
          disease outbreaks.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Preparation:</strong> Know your evacuation routes, avoid
          driving in flood waters, keep emergency supplies ready.

		<p>Fire. It is a chemical event that occurs when matter combines with heat and oxygen. In order for combustion to occur, matter, heat and oxygen (air) must be together.</p>
        <p>
          Wildfires spread rapidly and can destroy forests, homes, and wildlife.
          Most wildfires are caused by human activity or lightning strikes.
        </p>
        If there is a fire alarm button in the area, press it without panic, and report the fire to the fire department by calling 112. The address of the fire should be reported as briefly and accurately as possible, along with the type of fire (building, gasoline, wood, vehicle, etc.).
        <p>
          <strong>Effects:</strong> Air pollution, loss of life, destruction of
          property and nature.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Preparation:</strong> Create defensible space around your
          home, stay updated on fire warnings, prepare for evacuation.

          Tsunamis are giant waves caused by underwater earthquakes or volcanic
          eruptions. They can flood coastal areas with little warning.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Effects:</strong> Massive coastal flooding, destruction of
          buildings and infrastructure.
